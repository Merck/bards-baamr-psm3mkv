# psm3mkv 0.2.1

# 14 Apr 2024 - Version 0.2.1

Constraining calculations of restricted mean durations and the accompanying `vignette("background-mortality")` has been reworked. The calculations using integral/continuous methods was not reliable. Instead, `calc_allrmds` now has a `rmdmethod="disc"` option to allow for discretized calculations for a given timestep (defaulting at one week). There is a new collection of functions in `discrmd.R` to provide for this, as well as `constrain_survprob()` function, which constrains a vector of survival estimates at given times such that the underlying hazard is at least as great as in an accompanying lifetable.

# 26 Jan 2024 - Version 0.2

This version provides additional functionality to the calculation of restricted mean durations in `calc_allrmds`. These estimates may now be constrained by a lifetable (see `calc_ltsurv`) and discounting may now be applied. A vignette describing how to use this functionality is provided: `vignette("background-mortality")`.

There are also some changes to _pkgdown.yml to avoid the theming changes imposed in the 0.6.0 release of bslib 0.6.0, with thanks to @nanxstats.

# 5 Jan 2024 - Version 0.1.1

## Added PSM analysis functions (experimental)

Iâ€™ve merged some experimental functions into the main branch following the version 0.1 release package. These functions provide analyses of the constraints on mortality hazards and therefore survival implied by a PSM. They are: `calc_haz_psm()`, `calc_surv_psmpps()`, `pickout_psmhaz`, `graph_psm_hazards()`, and `graph_psm_survs()`.

# 1 Jan 2024 - Version 0.1

This is the initial release of the package, rather belatedly. The code dates to October 2023.
