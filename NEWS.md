## 5 Jan 2024 - Constraints implied by a PSM

Iâ€™ve merged some experimental functions into the main branch following the version 0.1 release package. These functions provide analyses of the constraints on mortality hazards and therefore survival implied by a PSM. They are: [calc_haz_psm()], [calc_surv_psmpps()], [pickout_psmhaz()], [graph_psm_hazards()], and [graph_psm_survs()].

# 1 Jan 2024 - Version 0.1

This is the initial release of the package, rather belatedly. The code dates to October 2023.
