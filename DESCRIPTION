Description: Fits and evaluates three-state partitioned survival analyses (PartSAs) and markov models (clock forward or clock reset) to Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) patient-level data. This data is typically collected in clinical trials in oncology. These model structures are typically considered in cost-effectiveness modeling in advanced/metastatic cancer indications.
