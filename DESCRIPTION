Description: Fits and evaluates three-state partitioned survival analyses
    (PartSAs) and markov models (clock forward or clock reset) to
    Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS)
    patient-level data. This data is typically collected in clinical trials
    in oncology. These model structures are typically considered in
    cost-effectiveness modeling in advanced/metastatic cancer indications.
