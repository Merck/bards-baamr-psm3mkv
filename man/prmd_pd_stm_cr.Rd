\value{
Numeric value in same time unit as patient-level data (weeks).

\description{
Calculates the mean duration in the progressed disease state for the clock reset state transition model. Requires a carefully formatted list of fitted survival regressions for necessary endpoints, and the time duration to calculate over. Wrapper with 'possibly' of \link{rmd_pd_stm_cr}. This function is called by \link{calc_allrmds}.
