\title{Safely calculate restricted mean duration in progressed disease state for clock forward markov model}
\usage{
prmd_pd_stm_cf(...)

}
\value{
Numeric value in same time unit as patient-level data (weeks).

\description{
Calculates the mean duration in the progressed disease state for the clock forward markov model. Requires a carefully formatted list of fitted survival regressions for necessary endpoints, and the time duration to calculate over. Wrapper with 'possibly' of \link{rmd_pd_stm_cf}. This function is called by \link{calc_allrmds}.
