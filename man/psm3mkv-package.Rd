\title{psm3mkv: Fit and Evaluate Three-State Partitioned Survival Analysis and Markov Models to Progression-Free and Overall Survival data}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

Fits and evaluates three-state partitioned survival analyses (PartSAs) and markov models (clock forward or clock reset) to Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) patient-level data. This data is typically collected in clinical trials in oncology. These model structures are typically considered in cost-effectiveness modeling in advanced/metastatic cancer indications.
