\title{Restricted mean duration for overall survival in the partitioned survival model}
\usage{
rmd_os_psm(dpam, Ty = 10, starting = c(1, 0, 0), discrate = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{dpam}{List of survival regressions for model endpoints. These must include time to progression (TTP) and pre-progression death (PPD).}

\item{Ty}{Time duration over which to calculate. Assumes input is in years, and patient-level data is recorded in weeks.}

\item{starting}{Vector of membership probabilities at time zero.}

\item{discrate}{Discount rate (\%) per year}
}
\value{
Numeric value in same time unit as patient-level data (weeks).
}
\description{
Calculates the mean duration alive (i.e. in either progression free or progressed disease states) for the partitioned survival model. Requires a carefully formatted list of fitted survival regressions for necessary endpoints, and the time duration to calculate over.
